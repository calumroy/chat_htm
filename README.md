# Chat HTM

A project for teaching HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) networks to learn patterns in simple text.

## Overview

This project uses [htm_flow](https://github.com/calumroy/htm_flow) as a library to build HTM-based models that can learn and recognize simple patterns in text pieces.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
```

Or if already cloned:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Install htm_flow dependencies:
```bash
cd htm_flow
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

3. Install project dependencies (when available):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Work in progress - HTM models for text pattern learning will be built on top of the htm_flow library.
